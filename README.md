## 📖 How to Access Nexus Market Safely

Accessing a darknet marketplace requires careful preparation to maintain anonymity and security. Follow these steps meticulously.

### 1. Download and Install Tor Browser
The Tor Browser is your gateway to the darknet. It anonymizes your internet traffic by routing it through a global network of servers.
*   **Action:** Download the official Tor Browser only from [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/). Avoid third-party download sources.

### 2. Access the Nexus Market URL
Once Tor Browser is running, you can access the marketplace.
*   **Action:** Enter the official **Nexus Market** Onion URL (<a href="http://%6e&#101;&#120;%75&#115;&#97;&#102;&#101;&#106;&#101;&#119;%34%35&#111;%73%71%61%61%77&#108;%32&#120;&#113;%6a%77&#109;&#105;&#110;&#99;%73&#102;%76&#106;%77&#117;&#119;%74&#109;&#50;%66%75&#109;%73&#50;&#107;&#106;&#101;&#111;%6e&#55;%74&#98;&#109;&#108;&#105;%64&#46;%6f%6e&#105;&#111;%6e/?&#116;=%35&#53;%65%39%62%33%30&#101;&#56;%32%33%35&#99;&#49;%61&#97;">Nexus official</a>) directly into the Tor Browser's address bar. Do not search for it on public search engines.

### 3. Create Your Account
Registration is the first step inside the platform.
*   **Action:** Choose a unique username that is not used on any other platform. Create a strong, complex password using a password manager. **Crucially, set up your PGP key pair at this stage.**

### 4. Enhance Your Security Posture
Basic access is not enough; you must adopt a security-first mindset.
*   **Use a VPN:** For an added layer of security, connect to a reputable, no-logs VPN service *before* launching the Tor Browser (this is known as "Tor over VPN").
*   **Disable JavaScript:** Within the Tor Browser's security settings, set the security level to "Safest" to disable JavaScript, mitigating potential exploit risks.
